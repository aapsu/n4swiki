Unity Mock Up
=======

Challenge
-------

Unity3D is a popular 3D rendering engine and a game development tool set used by hundreds of game studios and indie game developers. Unity is developed keeping the ease of use in mind, making it one of the first choices of beginner game developers, and its asset store has thousands of ready-made assets to save time and trouble in game projects. It is also used as a 3D renderer and a simulation environment in the software industry.

Solution
-------

We are going to simulate a mobile device in a "natural" environment using Unity3D as the rendering engine. The user interface mockup will be created using an external interface designer tool and the mockup is imported into Unity. The interface created with the mockup is projected on the screen of the simulated device, and the user will be able to interact with the interface and the environment outside of the device. Simulating a device with Unity will make it easier for the developer to see how easy the application is to use when deployed into a device even before the prototype is ready.


Technologies
-------

Unity3D with Awesomium plugin as web view. FluidUI as Mockup tool. More information about the technologies and their alternatives on the Challenge Unity Mockup page.
